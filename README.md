# hello-world
The very beginning to my coding journey
I'm starting on my path to learn as much programming as I possibly can. I've always looked at websites and apps with a mindset of "This can be imrpoved on" or worked on a project and thought of an idea as to make a simple app to simplify the work. Now I will be able to do so and tailor it to my preferences and I'm going to do so with the understanding that I will never completely learn everything there is to know about programming.
